     <h2>
      Origins
     </h2>
     From nothing, there was Chaos ... Unexplainably, from him there was Chaos and Erebus. There Love was born, and came its companion, Day. Then came Gaia (the earth) who gave birth to Uranus (the sky), and the numerous monsters were born. Three had a hundred heads and fifty hands, three were one-eyed Cyclopes, and then Titans. There was a plot that Cronus, the leader of the Titans, would be overthrown by his children, so he swallowed them up. What ensued, in the titanomachy, is linked below.

     <ol>
      <li>
       Zeus - The chief god, and the head of Mount Olympus. He ruled the sky and wielded the thunderbolt.
      </li>
      <li>
       Hera - Zeus' wife and sister. She was the goddess of marriage, and often took action against woman who fell in love with Zeus.
      </li>
      <li>
       Poseidon - Zeus' brother and the ruler of the sea. He had a trident, also was known for communicating/connecting with horses and bulls.
      </li>
      <li>
       Hades - The third brother. He was the ruler of the Underworld and the dead (so not technically considered an Olympian by some).
      </li>
      <li>
       Athena - A daughter of Zeus (alone), and was said to be born fully-grown and in armor, springing out of his head. She was the goddess of strategy and wisdom.

       Apollo - A master of instruments (particularly with his golden lyre), the bow-and-arrow, and also a healer. He is the god of light and truth.
      </li>
      <li>
       Artemis - Apollo's sister, and was known to be the goddess of the hunt. She had affinities with many (wild) animals.
      </li>
      <li>
       Aphrodite - The goddess of love and beauty, often known to sweep away anyone with her glamor. She was ironically married to the ugliest Olympian, Hephaestus.
      </li>
      <li>
       Hermes - A child of Zeus, swift and fraceful. He wore winged sandals as shoes. He was the messenger for the gods.

     <h2>
      Heroes
     </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Theseus - When he was born, his father placed a sword and shoes under a giant rock, and his father took him to take it and go to Athens when he matured (enough to lift it). Theseus is already a hero when he gets to Athens, as he kills murderous bandits cunningly along the way. He later "sacrifies" himself to the Minotaur, a beast who kills Athenian children every year as punishment. Theseus kills the Minotaur as its asleep, and then goes on to become the king of Athens. He restores democracy, and his rule is prosperous.
        </li>

        <li>
          Heracles - He was the strongest mortal man on earth, rivaling that of the gods, but this would become tragic. As a child, he had accidentally killed his music teacher by force, and when he was just an adult, he had slain a legendary lion. He has three children with Princess Megara, but this infuriates Hera, so she turns Heracles mad and sets him off to kill his family. Seeking repentence for his actions, Heracles consults the oracle at Delphi. And onword, he famously complete the twelve impossible Labors. This includes slaying hydra, retrieving Cerebrus, etc.

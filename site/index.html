      <h3 class="home_p"> Growing up in New York City, I've been fascinated by its scale and its glamor (for the most part). It's the largest city in America by a wide margin, attracts people from all around the world, and therehome home to an incredible variety of cultures. That, in part, captivates me to this city, as does the architecture. I love going to school everyday seeing the World Trade Center (the <i> World </i> Trade Center). As my first webpage, I have dedicated this site to some recommendations for places to go, food to eat, etc.
